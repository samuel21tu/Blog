          <h1>Racism</h1><br><br>
          <h3>When we deal with racism, we are dealing with a complex issue that is deeply rooted in society. Language plays a crucial role in perpetuating or deconstructing this problem.
            <br><br>
            Language is not just a set of words, gestures and children; it is intrinsically linked to culture and history. When we name someone, we are not just using nouns and adjectives, but we are also attributing existence to that person in the world in which they live.
            <br><br>
            Racism comes to life in language. When a white child calls a black child “monkey”, they dehumanize, animalize and inferiorize the other child. These words have detrimental effects on the targeted child's life. Likewise, when someone says: “I won't go to a black doctor” or “To work here, you need to fix your hair”, they are perpetuating racism and whiteness.
            <br><br>
            In linguistic education, we must be attentive to what we teach inside and outside formal institutions. Language can be used to offend, hurt and humiliate, but also to praise, motivate and love. Our words have power and impact.
            <br><br>
            Knowing the minefield that is language allows us to combat racism and other forms of oppression. We must use our language to transform, heal and build a more just and equal society1.
            <br><br>
            In short, the fight against racism is a responsibility of all of us, and language is a powerful tool in this process.</h3>
