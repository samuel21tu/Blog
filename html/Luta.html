        <h1>The fight against racism belongs to society as a whole</h1>
        <br><p>By: Stela Farias, state deputy (PT)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The beginning of August was marked by a case of racism that occupied the national and
          international news. I'm referring to the racist attack on the daughter and son of actors Giovanna
          Ewbank and Bruno Gagliasso, two black children, as well as an Angolan family, by a white woman
          on the coast of Portugal on July 30. Firstly, as a mother, my sympathy to Giovana for the reaction
          she had when she realized that her daughters were the victims of a brutal attack. The second issue I
          would like to reflect on in order to contribute to an understanding that I consider fundamental:
          racism is a problem for society as a whole. I repeat here the question asked by Giovanna Ewbank
          and Bruno Gagliasso in the interviews they gave to talk about the episode: what if the parents had
          been black, what would have happened? It's very sad to realize that perhaps the situation could have
          been different.<br><br>
          Unfortunately, this is the reality we see on a daily basis in episodes where black people, be they
          children, women, men, young people or the elderly, are verbally or physically attacked by racist
          acts. The news shows us this devastating reality every day. The 16th Brazilian Public Security
          Yearbook, released in July 2022, shows that 78% of the victims of violent deaths in Brazil are
          black, while 21.7% are white. In the case of police killings, the figure is even worse: 84% of the
          targets are black. The study also shows that 67.7% of military or civilian police officers killed in
          violent situations are black. In the case of women victims of femicide, 62% are black and 37.5% are
          white, which shows a structurally unequal reality when they need to seek help, reception or
          assistance from public services.<br><br>
          The figures show that racism is a structural problem, which makes this crime an issue that involves
          not only the black population, but mainly the white population. Brazil is a black and female
          country, located in an African and indigenous America, as Lélia Gonzalez teaches us. We are 56%
          black and 52% women. But unfortunately, our social, political and cultural history is structured on
          the violence of white European colonization, which made the kidnapping and enslavement of
          African peoples the basis of the Brazilian economy. A colonization that denies our cultural and
          social Africanness. There is no democracy in a country where 56% of the population is under
          constant threat, in a country where children, young people and adults run the risk of being
          imprisoned or killed because they are black.<br><br>
          The fight against racism needs to be incorporated as a white problem, above all because as a social
          group it is where racism is naturalized by denying its existence. Contrary to what racist ideologies
          claim, we do not live in a racial democracy. The figures above prove this. That's why it's not enough
          to be against racism, we need to have an anti-racist attitude.<br><br>
          In Djamila Ribeiro's book "Pequeno Manual Antirracista", the black feminist writer and thinker
          teaches us to seek self-questioning as an anti-racist method: "Where are the black people? Why aren't
          they here? If they are, where do they belong? Why? Breaking with racist ideology involves naming
          racism and, at the same time, questioning and confronting everyday practices that reinforce the
          culture of erasure and disrespect for the black population.<br><br>
          I am a white woman who lives in Alvorada, a peripheral city in the Metropolitan Region of Porto
          Alegre (RS), which I had the honor of governing for two terms. In Alvorada, the vast majority of
          residents are workers and make up diverse ethnic and racial groups: they are black, migrant,
          indigenous and white. During our terms in office, we implemented theParticipatory, where we seek to build priorities with the population in order to apply public
          resources to the well-being of families, whether they live in the city center or on the outskirts. In
          addition, we tried to build a respectful relationship with the Traditional Land Units (UTTs), since
          the city of Alvorada is one of the municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul with a significant presence of
          Land Units. In 2003, during my second term as mayor of Alvorada, we set up the Forum of Local
          Periphery Authorities (FALP), in the context of the 3rd World Social Forum. This network brought
          together global authorities from peripheral communities and in 2017 involved 250 local authorities
          from 32 countries seeking to reflect on public policies for the peripheries.<br><br>
          The current deepening of neoliberalism leaves no doubt about the destructive impact on peripheral
          communities: more poverty, the precariousness of public services and the expansion of racist and
          sexist violence, with the worsening of murders of the black population and feminicides.
          As public managers, I understand that racism and sexism need to be taken into account with cross-
          cutting race and gender policies so that public policies make progress in breaking with institutional
          and structural practices that ignore the specific realities of the peripheries, the black population,
          women, the LGBTQIA+ population and people with disabilities. We are fighting alongside these
          invisible and subalternized majorities.<br><br>
          A commitment to democracy means seeking a more inclusive society. And this inclusion will only
          be possible if we break with racist and misogynist institutional policies. As a former mayor and
          state deputy, a white woman active in politics, I think my duty as a feminist and anti-racist activist
          is to be an ally in the anti-racist struggle. We need to talk about whiteness, about what it means to
          belong to the white ethnic group and what we can do to denaturalize the racist violence that tries to
          erase Africanness from our culture and national identity. Fighting racism and sexism needs to be a
          commitment of society as a whole.<br><br>
          I sympathize with the artist couple in the face of the violence their daughters have suffered. But I
          also salute them for their awareness of using their condition of privilege (a white, wealthy and
          well-known couple) to denounce the world and show what should be an ethical and civilizing
          commitment of all of us, especially white people: fighting structural racism is a duty of the whole
          of society.</h3><br>
