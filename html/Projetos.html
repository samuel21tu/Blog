        <h2>Brazil Fund selects projects to combat racism in the country:</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>The Brazilian Human Rights Fund is committed to combating racism in the country. Recently, the fund announced the donation of R$1.25 million to 25 organizations that work in this important cause. The selection of projects will be carried out through a notice, registrations for which are open until March 25th, at 6pm. The results will be released from May 21st12.The issue of racism has been considered a priority for the Brazil Fund since its creation in 2007. In the first call for project support, launched in the same year, the foundation supported four initiatives developed by organizations founded and led by black people. Since then, the Brazil Fund has continued to support projects that confront racism in its various forms and propose paths towards a country with more racial justice.The deputy superintendent of Fundo Brasil, Allyne Andrade, highlights the importance of mobilizing the black population for Brazilian democracy. Although the numbers of violence and exclusion are still alarming, there have been significant advances. For example, since 2019, black students have been the majority among those enrolled in federal higher education institutions, thanks to the quota policy. Furthermore, the number of black and black parliamentarians has been growing. All of this is the result of decades of pressure from black people organized in social movements. The Brazil Fund's mission is to support this movement and contribute to positive changes in the country's racial scenario1.In the last five years, Fundo Brasil has donated more than R$2.6 million to 50 collectives and non-profit groups in all Brazilian regions and states. These organizations work directly in their territories and communities, promoting racial justice and combating various forms of racism. The results of the work of these collectives demonstrate how their actions are capable of transforming local realities, contributing to a broad movement of social transformation. For example: Coletivo Cirandas, in Rio Grande do Norte, offers legal advice to traditional communities, including territorial protection and support for quilombola leaders at risk of death in Bahia.The Mother Hilda Jitolu Black Women's Institute, launched in Salvador (BA), aims to consolidate the community's actions in promoting the rights of black women and combating religious racism1.The Brazil Fund continues to play a fundamental role in the fight against racism, supporting projects that seek a more equal and fair country for all.<a href="https://www.fundobrasil.org.br/edital/edital-enfrentando-o-racismo-a-partir-da-base-2024/">Click here to learn more...</a></h3>
