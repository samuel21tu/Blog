          <h1>Racism in Brazil:</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>Although we have, throughout Brazilian history, created legislation that recognizes our
            diversity, we are a long way from the necessary social inclusion. We have faced difficult times,
            dictatorships, political and economic crises, but the democracy we won thirty years ago inspires
            us to continue, building a society based on law that respects our diversity and expresses all
            citizens. Going back to the first centuries of our state, we see how the law expressed social and
            economic relations, based on slave labor, and so we come to the leading role of Africans in
            Brazilian history.<br><br>
            Without a doubt, the enslavement of Africans and Afro-descendants was the contradictory point
            of Brazilian liberalism. Slavery grew during the golden age of liberalism - which praised
            freedom combined with the main objective of the bourgeois class, the right to private property.
            In the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, liberal ideas were introduced by young
            people from wealthy families who studied in Europe. Our first Constitution was the
            monarchical one of 1824, considered to be liberal in nature. It made no reference to the
            economic system adopted, since it was the slave-owning system that was called slavery. The
            liberalism of the "house" served the salons and was therefore never effectively applied.
            Liberal ideology was only experimented with in the nativist revolts to overcome and throw off
            the Portuguese yoke, but with reservations. At their peak, the revolutions came to a head with
            men and weapons, at a time when the majority of the population was black and enslaved.
            Arming enslaved hands? Never! Thus, the liberal revolutions were eliminated.
            However, it was the imperial government that, by participating in the biggest international
            confrontation ever to hit the country, the Paraguayan War, ended up arming slaves in exchange
            for citizenship.<br><br>
            Once the war was over in 1870, there were no conditions to maintain enslavement. The
            dismantling of work in rural areas, the formation of political movements and, above all, escapes
            and new quilombos marked a new era, since the battalions of the Volunteers of the Fatherland
            did not return their weapons to the National Army and the country was never the same again.
            <br><br><h1>Human beings and the right to freedom:</h1><br><br>
            <h3>There are no slaves, never have been, and never will be. Human beings, under physical or
            symbolic violence, have been enslaved, but not slaves. A slave is an inert being convinced of
            his inferiority to the oppressor, subordinate in all spheres of life. No human being is.
            What the world knows about domination - I add slavery, slavery, slavery - are forms of
            violence, preventing and opposing the exercise of freedom. Someone, often in the guise of love
            or protection, subjugates people. In families, in love relationships, there are soft and rational
            ways of enslaving others through forms of symbolic violence.
            Symbolic violence, as thought of by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, constrains, subjugates
            and causes moral pain.<br><br>
            Freedom is a condition of the human species, it is part of human nationality. Freedom is
            opposed to enslavement, although slavery is only the domination of forms of enslavement as
            they were in ancient times. Kant's contributions confirm the dignityis an attribute of every human being, and so is freedom. Only by violent means can people be
            enslaved. One thinks freely, the right to think is free and therefore absolute. The law,
            expressing the sense of what is fair in society, is responsible for guaranteeing expressions of
            the exercise of this freedom - be it communication, movement, permanence or beliefs - but it is
            also its duty to discipline it.<br><br></h3>
            <h1>Slavery and enslavement:</h1><br>
            <h3>Slavery, therefore, was an important legal institute in the ancient world. Our law, being Roman-
            based, requires us to study Roman law. Respected Brazilian jurists and historians, including
            Alexandre Correa and Evaristo de Morais, argue that in Brazil (colony and empire) Roman law
            was used as a subsidiary to Brazilian law. Unlike Brazil, in ancient Rome there was no racial
            enslavement, but rather that which served interests, hence the enslavement for debt or the
            enslavement of defeated enemies in wars. Among us, it was and is quite different, since the
            discriminatory ethnic issue was very manifest.<br><br>
            In Rome, if the union between masters and their enslaved women produced children, the
            children would be free, as it was repugnant to Roman parents to enslave their own children. In
            Brazil, however, it was this enslavement that gave rise to our miscegenation. In our country
            there were a number of terrible practices for which there was no constitutional punishment,
            including the enslavement of black women by their landlords who forced them into prostitution,
            many of whom even bought black women for these purposes. Even with the advent of the first
            Brazilian Criminal Code, in 1830, this crime was not included among the provisions, as it was a
            very common commercial practice in Brazilian cities. In Evaristo de Morais' research, there are
            reports of
            foreign visitors who reported masters documenting their female slaves with "permission slips"
            authorizing them to remain on the streets after curfew.<br><br>
            During its four centuries, slavery in Brazil was also part of an important cycle in the socio-
            economic system of capitalism in its mercantile phase, which had already reached its first
            industrialization. Brazil's relations with England were intense, as the British profited from
            human trafficking, accumulating enough capital to invest in its industrialization. Thus, in the
            19th century, the English liberal bourgeoisie was no longer interested in slavery. Instead, they
            needed consumer markets for their manufactures, and if they
            were imposed among the producing states with a broad campaign against "slavery". In Brazil,
            however, trafficking continued illegally, even after the creation of the Law of November 7,
            1831, which declared Africans imported after the ban free and incriminated traffickers under
            the terms of article 179 of the Criminal Code. It also continued after the creation of the Eusébio
            de Queirós Law (Law 581 of September 4, 1850). Economic interests certainly prevailed, given
            that 560,000 Africans were illegally brought to Brazil during this period. The expression "law
            for English to see" comes from the non-compliance with the Eusébio de Queirós Law.
            The exclusion of black citizens in our country is striking because, as enslaved people, they
            were everywhere: in the mines, given their knowledge of metallurgy, in the cities they weregoldsmiths and in agriculture they had a deep knowledge of land and plantations. They were
            also barbers, dressmakers, musicians, etc. The image of the enslaved was part of the urban and
            rural landscape, as many of their works well expressed.<br><br>
            Thus, even though they have gained citizenship, black Brazilians have become invisible,
            absent from all public and private institutions. Except in public prisons, mental institutions and
            the real extensions of the slums and outskirts of Brazilian cities. In the 19th century, blacks
            made up approximately 53% of the national population, but they remained on the margins of
            development. As the immigration of free European workers began in 1811, white working
            families and enslaved blacks lived together for almost a hundred years. Monarchist normative
            acts, which were manifestly racist, clearly demonstrate the choice of immigration by families
            and by certain regions of Europe.<br><br>
            The immigration policy was welcoming to Europeans, providing administrative structures with
            positions and public funds. The political will was for inclusion. However, no measures were
            taken to include black people. While they were enslaved, the reactions were rebellions and the
            formation of quilombos or liberation actions; only with the lawsuits brought by Luís Gama, an
            important lawyer for blacks before the courts, were dozens of enslaved people freed. When in
            the legal position of freedmen, blacks did not vote in the monarchical legislature and were
            constantly forced to clarify their status as freed citizens, as they were always suspected of being
            runaway slaves. To be black in Brazil was to be a slave, so to be a slave and free you had to
            prove it.<br><br>
            Thus, the manifestly racist legislation in itself reveals the slave-owning monarchy, but also the
            unequal republic, since Deodoro da Fonseca's first decrees, in 1890, prohibited the immigration
            of Africans. Added to this, there was no integration policy for black Brazilians. Later, in 1938,
            Getúlio Vargas introduced decree-law number 406, in which the federal government reserved
            the right to limit or suspend, for economic or social reasons, the entry of individuals of certain
            races or origins, after consulting the immigration and colonization council.<br><br>
            It is therefore urgent that Brazil recognizes its adversity under the aegis of the current Federal
            Constitution in force for the last thirty years. It must recognize the importance of the dignity of
            the human person as a structuring principle for the recognition of human rights. I would like to
            highlight here the UN's determinations prohibiting forms of discrimination, whether ethnic or
            gender-based, to which Brazil is a signatory. Today, we live with specific legislation on the
            rights of vulnerable groups (children, adolescents, women, blacks, indigenous people, trans
            people, etc). We have created affirmative action policies, seeing discriminated and marginalized
            collective subjects in society, treating them differently, in other words, discriminating against
            them positively, seeking protective measures to include them in development</h3><br><br>
